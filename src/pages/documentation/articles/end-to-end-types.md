# End to End Type

Having TypeScript used in all your services like frontend, backend, microservice, CLI, database, etc. is a huge benefit. It allows you to share code between all these services, and it allows you to use the full power of TypeScript to make your code more robust and maintainable.

End to End Types means that you use TypeScript types as source of truth for your data structures, and you use the same TypeScript types for validation, serialization, database, HTTP Routes, CLI, RPC, and more.

TODO: Describe the benefits of End to End Types with a concrete example and why Deepkit is the only framework that supports it completley. Show how tRPC is not end-to-end. Use a visual diagram to show the difference.
